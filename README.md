# Socially Normative Robot Navigation Behaviors

This meta-package contains a set of packages that implement different
socially normative mobile robot navigation behaviors particularly geared 
at service robots operating in crowded scenes.

## Depencies
* C++11 compiler
* ROS setup (including `move_base`, rviz)
* Spencer related messages and robot control

## Usage
```
# checkout into a catkin workspace
catkin build socially_normative_navigation
roslaunch snn_launchers lobby.launch
```

## Limitations

- costmap areas that are distant from the robot (distance defined by the `update_range`) are left as they are once the robot moves away (therefore there are strange artifacts at the boundaries of the costmap)
  - this applies to both `SocialComplianceLayer` and `FlowBehaviorLayer`
